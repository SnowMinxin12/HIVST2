#### basic coding rules

## 1. file naming
##    Function files start with F
##    Code files start with C
##    Numbers indicate the flow of codes
##      0x = data reading
##      1x = data screening
##      3x = model building and analysis
##      (to be added)

## 2. begin each file by copy and fill in the following lines:
###  file_name.R
###  summary of things done in this file
###  author: XXX
### input: datasets_name or R_files_names 
### output: output_file_name

## 3. working directory
##    Working directory is the root of the R project (HIVST2)
##    on your local directory, create 3 folders "script", "data", "output" under the project root directory
##    store data under the file named "data", R scripts under "script", your results under "output"
##    Only share codes on github, share results through email

## 3. rule
##    Binary variables: 0=Yes, 1=No
